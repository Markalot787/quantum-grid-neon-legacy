Understanding the Logic and Gameplay of I.Q.: Intelligent Qube
I.Q.: Intelligent Qube, also known as Kurushi in Europe, is a classic puzzle game developed by G-Artists and released for the PlayStation in 1997. It combines mental agility with physical reflexes, creating a unique and challenging experience. Below, I’ll fully explain the game’s logic, rules, gameplay mechanics, map design, conditions for winning and losing, strategies to succeed, and how the maps progress—all based on available information, including web insights.
Gameplay Logic and Rules
The core of I.Q.: Intelligent Qube involves controlling a character on a rectangular platform made of cubes. Waves of cubes roll toward you, and your task is to capture specific cubes before they fall off the edge while avoiding others. The platform shrinks as you make mistakes, adding tension to the puzzle-solving process.
Cube Types
The game features three distinct types of cubes, each with its own role:
Normal Cubes: These are the standard cubes you must capture. Failing to capture them before they fall off the stage can lead to penalties.
Forbidden Cubes (Black Cubes): These cubes must not be captured. Capturing a forbidden cube causes you to lose a row of the stage, reducing your playable area.
Advantage Cubes (Green Cubes): Capturing these allows you to set a trap that clears a 3x3 area of cubes when activated. They’re key to managing large waves efficiently.
Basic Mechanics
Here’s how you interact with the cubes:
Marking a Spot: Press the 'X' button (on the PlayStation controller) to mark a square on the stage where a cube will roll.
Capturing a Cube: As a cube rolls over the marked spot, press 'X' again to deactivate the mark and capture the cube. Timing is critical.
Avoiding Forbidden Cubes: Let forbidden cubes roll off the stage without capturing them. Capturing one costs you a row.
Using Advantage Cubes: When you capture an advantage cube, it sets a trap. Activating this trap (often with another button press, like 'Circle') clears all cubes in a 3x3 grid around it—perfect for clearing multiple normal cubes at once.
Stage Dynamics
Platform Setup: The stage starts with 23-30 rows of cubes, and 12-16 rows are raised as the active playing area.
Row Loss: You lose rows in two ways:
Capturing a Forbidden Cube: Instantly lose one row.
Normal Cubes Falling Off: If too many normal cubes fall off (exceeding a "block scale" limit), you lose a row. The exact limit varies by stage but is typically a small number of missed cubes.
Game Over: If you lose too many rows, the stage becomes too small, and you either fall off the edge or get crushed by the rolling cubes.
How to Win
To win a stage, you must:
Capture all normal cubes in each wave before they fall off the stage.
Avoid capturing forbidden cubes.
Clear the wave without losing too many rows.
A perfect clear—capturing all normal cubes without mistakes—may reward you with bonuses, such as extra rows added to the stage or a “Perfect!” announcement. To win the game entirely, you must complete all stages (typically nine), though your ultimate goal could also be achieving a high I.Q. score.
How to Lose
The game ends if:
You Fall Off the Stage: Losing too many rows shrinks the platform until there’s no space left, causing you to fall.
You Get Crushed: If you’re caught between rolling cubes and can’t move, the cubes crush you.
Both scenarios result from poor cube management—either capturing forbidden cubes or letting too many normal cubes escape.
Map Design
Stage Structure
Initial Layout: Each stage begins with a platform of 23-30 rows, with 12-16 rows raised for gameplay. The cubes roll across this raised section toward the edge.
Waves: A stage consists of about 12 waves of cubes. Each wave brings a new pattern of normal, forbidden, and advantage cubes.
Cube Patterns
Early stages feature simple patterns with fewer cubes and slower speeds.
Later stages introduce:
Larger platforms (wider areas with more cubes).
Faster rolling speeds.
More complex patterns, including increased numbers of forbidden and advantage cubes.
How Maps Progress
The game has nine stages, each progressively harder:
Stage 1: Basic patterns, slower cubes, fewer forbidden cubes.
Middle Stages: More cubes per wave, faster speeds, and trickier layouts with forbidden cubes mixed in.
Later Stages: Larger platforms, rapid cube movement, and reliance on advantage cubes to clear dense formations.
As you clear each stage, you advance to the next, facing new challenges. The difficulty curve emphasizes both mental planning (pattern recognition) and physical skill (reflexes).
Strategy to Win
Winning requires a blend of strategy and execution. Here are the key tactics:

1. Prioritize Normal Cubes
   Capture every normal cube to avoid losing rows. Missing too many triggers the “block scale” penalty.
2. Master Advantage Cubes
   Use green cubes strategically to clear multiple normal cubes in one go. Position the 3x3 trap to maximize captures while avoiding forbidden cubes nearby.
3. Avoid Forbidden Cubes
   Let black cubes roll off naturally. If they’re near normal cubes, use advantage traps carefully to clear around them without triggering a capture.
4. Manage Stage Rows
   Monitor how many normal cubes fall off. Stay under the block scale limit to preserve your platform.
5. Positioning and Awareness
   Stay ahead of the rolling cubes to avoid being crushed. Move between rows if needed, but watch your footing as the stage shrinks.
6. Recognize Patterns
   Cube waves often follow predictable sequences. Learn these to plan your marks and traps ahead of time.
7. Quick Reflexes
   Later stages demand fast reactions. Practice timing your marks and captures precisely, especially as speeds increase.
   Advanced Tips
   Green Cube Efficiency: In later stages, rely heavily on advantage cubes, as manual captures become impractical for large waves.
   Risky Moves: Experienced players might walk between flipping cube rows to place triggers, though this risks being crushed.
   Quota Flexibility: Focus on beating the stage, even if it means using more moves than the “ideal” quota.
   Additional Elements
   Scoring System: After each game, you receive an I.Q. score based on efficiency—fewer mistakes and faster clears yield higher scores.
   Characters: Unlockable characters (e.g., Eliot, Cynthia) have different speeds. Cynthia, being faster, might help in tougher stages.
   Two-Player Mode: Players alternate turns, but the core mechanics remain unchanged.
   Summary
   I.Q.: Intelligent Qube challenges you to capture rolling normal cubes on a shrinking platform while avoiding forbidden cubes and leveraging advantage cubes for efficiency. Winning involves clearing all nine stages by managing waves of cubes without losing too many rows or getting crushed. The maps progress from simple, slow patterns to fast, complex layouts requiring sharp reflexes and planning. Strategies hinge on pattern recognition, precise timing, and smart use of advantage cubes.
   This game’s logic is a test of both brain and brawn—a minimalist yet intense puzzle experience that grows more demanding with each stage. Whether you’re aiming to beat all stages or maximize your I.Q. score, understanding these mechanics is your key to success!
